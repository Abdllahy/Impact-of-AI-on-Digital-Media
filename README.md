# Impact-of-AI-on-Digital-Media

Welcome to the Impact of AI on Industries End-to-End Analysis Project. This project simulates a real-world scenario where data storytelling and actionable insights drive decision-making. As a Data Analyst, i worked through each stage of the analytical process to solve key challenges and answer pressing research questions.

## Project Overview
In this project, my goal is to analyze the global influence of artificial intelligence (AI) across industries and countries. Using structured data, I explore how AI adoption affects revenue growth, job loss, public trust, and content generation across sectors.

This project focuses on three main analytical areas:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Cleaning, transforming, and visualizing AI impact data.

Hypothesis Testing: Answering key research questions using SQL queries and descriptive statistics.

Regression Modelling (Optional): Laying the foundation for a predictive model to explore relationships between AI adoption and performance metrics.

## 🔍 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### ✅ Data Cleaning
Handled missing values in key fields such as AI adoption rates, trust scores, and revenue figures.

Standardized column names (e.g., Country, AI_Adoption_Rate, Job_Loss).

Resolved encoding issues (e.g., BOM in Country column).

### 📊 Data Exploration Highlights:
AI adoption rates vary widely between countries, with Automotive and Manufacturing showing the highest uptake.

Trust levels differ significantly, with Germany, Australia, and Canada scoring highest in public trust.

Tools like Midjourney and Claude dominate in usage across industries.

### 📌 Visual Tools Used:
Tableau for interactive dashboards

Excel for quick insights and initial visualizations

## ❓ 2. Hypothesis Testing
### Q1: Which industry is experiencing the highest revenue growth due to AI?
The Automotive industry leads with a 46.48% average revenue increase due to AI integration.

### Q2: Is there a correlation between AI adoption and consumer trust?
Industries with high AI adoption (like Automotive and Media) do not always enjoy high consumer trust — suggesting an inverse or weak correlation.

### Q3: Do countries with stricter AI regulations have higher public trust?
Countries with moderate or strict regulation, like Germany and the USA, show higher trust scores than countries with lenient frameworks.

### Q4: Which industry generates the most AI content?
The Gaming industry is the top content generator with over 1,200.7 TBs produced.

### Q5: Are AI tools usage patterns globally consistent?
No. Usage patterns vary:

Midjourney is dominant in visual-heavy sectors (Gaming, Media).

Claude is preferred in legal, educational, and writing-based domains.
